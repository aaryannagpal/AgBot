## Building the AgBot
### Assembling the Chasis
For this project, we created the frame of our robot using Acrylic Chassis. In total, we used laser cutter to create four of them to create the body, with several openings for the motor axes and screws. The ```CAD``` file is attached in the repository.

The chassis looks like this: <br>

Two of them has their length side bent 90 degrees to create the side chassis. It was bent at a distance of 54 mm from each ends of the breadth. The side chassis look like:
